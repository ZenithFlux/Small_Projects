## Tools used

- R (Data Cleaning and Analysis)
- Tableau (Visualization)

## Insights

Through the analysis we can conclude that:

- An average person takes 7638 steps per day, which is lower than the recommended number of steps i.e 10,000.

- Most of the activity takes place between 9AM and 7PM, which matches with usual office hours. This suggests that the people who provided the data are mostly in physically active jobs.

- People tend to wear their smart devices less frequently from Wednesday to Saturday.

- There is a weak positive correlation between the steps taken, total active minutes, total distance walked and calories burnt. The outliers may be the people who do a lot of gym exercises (which do not involve walking or running).

- People spend most of their time sitting. Interesting to note that the time spent being very active is more than that spent fairly active.

## Recommendations

Some recommendations for improving the product and marketing strategy:

- Keep a track on which weekdays the user is less likely to wear the device. Remind the user by giving them a notification on those particular days.

- Encourage people to go for a walk outside the office hours if they don't burn enough calories for the day.

- When the device detects that the user is sitting for a long time, alert them to take a light 5 min walk.

- Allow users to set daily steps or distance goals. Since these metrics are correlated with calories burnt, it will help users achieve their weight loss goals.

All these features can be advertised for marketing purposes.
